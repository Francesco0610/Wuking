Learn the basis of Unity and C# to create an HardCore game

## Purposes

Quello che voglio fare creando questo gioco √® il primo passo verso il mondo dei videogiochi con ambiente Unity, lo studio dei tools integrati e delle possibilit√† e libert√† che ho attraverso questo software.
Quanto √® personalizzabile e se sono limitato al solo software oppure √® possibile fare le stesse cose nello stesso tempo.

# The Idea of The Game

The protagonist is a human in an armor, that is trapped in this box-world where he can only survive dodging every dangerous things that appears randomly in this crazy world.
E' davvero cos√¨ difficile sopravvivere per un minuto?


# What I learned and I want to learn

I learned that there are a lot of things that I can use to simplify my work as a programmer, on the Internet I can find a lot of assets or template, or even PreFab! 
Where did I am studying? You can find everything in the Unity documentation: [Unity Doc](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html)

# Something about the game // waiting for Updates

I learned how to create an enginge that can simulate Physic World where I can "summon" my protagonist inside this 2D world, then I used scripts in C# to let him move to left and right, and up and down.
I tried many things like audio sorce for the music etc, just to know all about unity but not for the purpose of the game.



*Next Updates: For the near future I will implement the collisions and the game loop, so the game would be finished and playble, I will create a section on how to install it and play it!*
